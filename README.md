## Monitoring

Check system health:

- `/global-status` - Full system overview
- `/memory-stats` - Memory utilization
- `/learning-metrics` - Learning progress
- `/team-health` - Individual team status

## Contributing

The system continuously improves itself, but human guidance accelerates learning:

- Provide feedback on generated solutions
- Approve/reject proposed strategies
- Guide architectural decisions
- Set learning priorities

## System Components

### Core Orchestration
- **Meta Orchestrator**: Coordinates all teams and manages cross-team communication
- **Memory Manager**: Handles persistent storage across all memory types
- **Knowledge Curator**: Identifies and distributes learnings across teams
- **Evolution Engine**: Continuously optimizes team strategies using genetic algorithms

### Team Specialization
Each team has 4 specialized agents:
- **Domain Experts**: Deep knowledge in specific areas
- **Learning Agents**: Continuously improve team performance
- **Coordination Agents**: Handle inter-team communication
- **Quality Agents**: Ensure output meets standards

### Memory Architecture
- **ChromaDB**: Vector storage for semantic memory
- **Neo4j**: Graph database for knowledge relationships
- **Redis**: Fast access for episodic memory
- **Kafka**: Event streaming for team communication

### Learning Systems
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Optimizes decision-making based on outcomes
- **Genetic Algorithms**: Evolves team strategies over time
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies successful workflows
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Shares learnings across teams

## Performance Metrics

The system tracks comprehensive metrics:
- **Velocity**: Development speed and throughput
- **Quality**: Code quality and defect rates
- **Efficiency**: Resource utilization and optimization
- **Learning**: Knowledge acquisition and transfer rates
- **Autonomy**: Percentage of autonomous decisions
- **Resilience**: System stability and recovery times

## Use Cases
